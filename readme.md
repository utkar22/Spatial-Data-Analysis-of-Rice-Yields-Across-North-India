# Exploratory (Spatial) Data Analysis for Rice Yields in the Indo-Gangetic Plains â€“ 2018-19

This repository contains an exploratory (spatial) data analysis report for rice yields in the Indo-Gangetic Plains during the 2018-19 season. The analysis aims to understand the sources of spatial heterogeneity in yields and explore the differences in yields based on various factors.

- All plots are geo-coded with an accuracy of <10 metres
- Provided by the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT)
- Detailed information on sampling design can be found in (Ajay et al. 2022)
- Similar data for wheat is also available (Ajay et al. 2021)
- Focus of analysis: Rice production

## Explanation of Work Done
The analysis report in this repository explores the spatial patterns and factors influencing rice yields in the Indo-Gangetic Plains during the 2018-19 season. The main objectives of the analysis include:

1. **Crop Yield Analysis:** Examining the overall distribution of rice yields and identifying high and low-yield areas within the study region.

2. **Spatial Heterogeneity in Crop Yields:** Investigating the sources of spatial heterogeneity in rice yields and exploring the relationship between yields and various geographic and environmental factors.

3. **Sub-Agroecological Zones Analysis:** Dividing the study region into sub-agroecological zones and analyzing the differences in yields and yield determinants across these zones.

4. **Input Application Analysis:** Assessing the impact of different input applications, such as fertilizer usage and irrigation practices, on rice yields and identifying potential opportunities for improvement.

Please refer to the report for detailed information, data visualizations, and findings related to the above analyses.
