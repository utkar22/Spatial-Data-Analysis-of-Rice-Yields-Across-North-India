# Exploratory (Spatial) Data Analysis for Rice Yields in the Indo-Gangetic Plains â€“ 2018-19

This repository contains an exploratory (spatial) data analysis report for rice yields in the Indo-Gangetic Plains during the 2018-19 season. The analysis aims to understand the sources of spatial heterogeneity in yields and explore the differences in yields based on various factors.
